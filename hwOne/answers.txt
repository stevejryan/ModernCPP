1) Count how many lines are there in "data.dat".

`wc data.dat` -> 175.  I checked on a small test file and it seems like EOF counts as a newline, so you don't need to adjust to account for the fencepost problem.

2) Count how many lines of those contain "dolor" or "dalor"?

`grep -E "dolor|dalor" data.dat | wc` -> 106 lines

How would I do this if some lines contain multiple instances and I wanted to know the total number of instances? Unclear.

3) Count how many words are there in "data.dat"?

1,904

4) Count how many of those start with "mol"?

`grep -E '\bmol' data.dat | wc` -> 36
\b for the blank character at beginning and ending of words

5) Count how many files in "test_folder" are ".txt" files?

`ls -l | wc' -> 101
